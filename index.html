          I grew up in North Carolina, where a bit of NASCAR rubbed off on me.
          There was once a time I believed I was the next Evel Knievel. Anything
          with wheels on it; I was trying to see how far off the ground I could
          get, whether it be mounds of dirt, make shift ramps or the neighbor's
          driveway (that was the best one)... <br />
          <br />
          This passion for the extreme continued through many different
          activities, bringing me to work the in outdoor industry where my skill
          set in data analysis and eventually coding began. Now, through my
          industry and education I have a knowledge of fully responsive custom
          designed websites, while continuing to learn more languages to keep
          ahead of best design and layout. <br />
          <br />
          I currently work as a Sr Data Analysis at
          <a href="https://hoodieanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Hoodie Analytics</a>,
          where I have a passion for large data analytics and consumers trends.
          Outside of work I have a 4 year old black and white Staffordshire
          Terrier mix named Lana and an awesome girlfriend. Currently I am not
          accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know
          you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.
