            F1 plans immediate reduction in new budget cap, reveals Brawn
          </h4>
          <p>
            Ross Brawn has revealed Formula 1 is planning to reduce the amount
            teams can spend under the new budget cap by $30m from the original
            figure of $175m, as the sport looks to cut costs in the wake of the
            coronavirus pandemic.
            <br />A cost cap of $175m was set to introduced in 2021 but in light
            of the F1 season having been delayed because of the virus outbreak
            and the subsequent economic squeeze on the sport and the teams,
            Brawn says the new annual spending cap will be set at $145m. The aim
            is to create a glidepath thereafter, further reducing teams' annual
            spending, once final talks with the teams have been concluded.

            Climbers Cautiously Return to the Rocks As States and Countries
            Relax Stay-At-Home Orders
          </h4>
          <p>
            While the battle against COVID-19 is projected to last into 2021,
            possibly beyond, many states are beginning to relax the strictest
            policies in their stay-at-home orders. As they do so, more and more
            climbers will be returning to the crags and boulders they have
            largely avoided in the past two months, prompting both excitement
            and apprehension over climbers’ ability to maintain proper social
            distancing. <br />

            Notably, on April 30, California Governor Gavin Newsom released new
            guidelines for permissible recreational activities (provided that
            social distancing measures are observed), and rock climbing is among
            them. While California’s stay-at-home order has no firm expiration
            date, the state is gradually introducing policies aimed at slowly
            reopening parts of the state.

            As Ferrari Gets Back to Building Cars, Workers Tested for COVID-19
            Antibodies
          </h4>
          <p>
            Ferrari has started a gradual ramp-up back to full production in
            Italy after several weeks of shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.
            The Italian government is allowing companies to resume operations as
            of Monday, May 4, if they follow health precautions. So, in line
            with those requirements, the automaker has put stringent safety
            measures into effect and has been training workers in the new
            procedures this week before going back to full production on Friday,
            May 8. Workers are going through a safety training program Ferrari
            has named "Back on Track." <br />
            Between late April and that full restart date, the automaker has
            also started giving all of its 4000 workers a blood test checking
            for the presence of antibodies to the coronavirus, on a voluntary
            basis. So far, as the Wall Street Journal reported late last week,
            less than 1 percent of the 2000 workers already tested have come
            back testing positive for antibodies, which could mean (depending on
            how effective the tests turn out to be) that they have not had the
            virus. <br />
