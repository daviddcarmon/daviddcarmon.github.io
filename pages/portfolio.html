            Race against Lando Norris in our new #ChallengeLando Esports event
          </h4>
          <p>
            The F1 season may still be on hold, but that won't stop Lando Norris
            from racing – and now he wants to take YOU on in a brand new Esports
            event, #ChallengeLando. <br />

            This Sunday the McLaren star will be taking on a series of racing
            challenges on Codemasters F1 2019 game, and you could be among the
            racers battling him on track - read on for details on how to get
            involved. All the action will be broadcast live here on F1.com, on
            F1's YouTube and Facebook channels, and on Twitch – at 2000 GMT.
            <br />

            For each challenge win Lando will receive points towards a final
            score, with a total of 15 points up for grabs – but he will go into
            the event without knowing who he will be facing...

            Support Climbing Gyms: Sign the Petition for Stimulus Inclusion and
            More
          </h4>
          <p>
            Hundreds of climbing gyms across the country have closed their doors
            amid the COVID-19 outbreak to prevent the spread of the virus. Many
            of these gyms are small businesses and integral pieces of the
            climbing community that may not survive a weeks- or months-long
            closure. Take a look at this list compiled by the Climbing Business
            Journal to see the staggering number of gyms that have closed their
            doors. When this period of self-isolation is over and businesses
            begin to reopen, we hope our climbing gyms will still be there. Here
            is what you can do to help.</p>

            The Climbing Wall Association (CWA) has sent an open letter to key
            government officials requesting that they include provisions for the
            fitness and recreation industry—with a particular emphasis on
            climbing gyms—in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief stimulus
            package. The stimulus package passed the Senate on Wednesday, and
            will be voted on by Congress Friday morning. <br />

            The letter to Congress reads: “Climbing gyms and other fitness and
            recreational facilities all face severe layoffs and the threat of
            bankruptcy during this crisis. This has affected, and will affect,
            tens of thousands of Americans. Without any fault of their own,
            climbing gyms are losing their ability to provide for members and
            employees due to lost revenue on account of massive forced
            closures.”

            Florida man buys race track, says I just want to have fun with my
            friends
          </h4>
          <p>
            “This is the perfect playground for us car guys to have a lot of
            fun,” said new owner Cleetus McFarland.
            <br />
            McFarland has racked in over 1.8 million subscribers on his Youtube
            channel.
            <br />
            Originally from Nebraska, McFarland made his way to Clearwater,
            where he and his team rehab old cars and test them out on the track.
            <br />
            The group calls it “live action."
            <br />
            “It requires a lot of breaking things, a little bit of fixing, and
            then more breaking,” said team member James Taal.
            <br />
            After four years of making videos, McFarland said he saw an
            opportunity of a lifetime: instead of rehabbing cars, he’s now
            remodeling the DeSoto Speedway.
            <br />
            The team renamed it the “Freedom Factory.” It's where they hope to
            bring online and motorsports fans together for a one-of-a-kind
            attraction.
            <br />
            “We are going to incorporate the old stuff, like circle track
            racing, but also intertwine the modern type of entertainment,”
            McFarland told us.
            <br />
            McFarland says he expects to open the Freedom Factory to the public
            sometime this year.
            <br />
            Shirts for the Freedom Factory are now available. All proceeds from
            t-shirt sales go to remodeling the speedway. <br />
